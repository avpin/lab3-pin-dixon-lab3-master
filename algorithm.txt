Algorithm

1.) Print to the user "This program will determine whether your distance traveled from the ski jump is par or above par."

2.) Input the type of hill, normal or large.

3.) If the height is entered as "normal", height=46, points_per_meter = 2, par = 90.
    Elif the height is entered as "large", height=70, points_per_meter = 1.8, par = 120.

4.) Input the velocity of the jump.

5.) Calculate time using math.sqrt((2*height)/9.8)

6.) Calculate the distance using velocity*time

7.) Calculate the points earned using 60+(distance-par)*points_per_meter, assign it as an int, and then print the output
    to the user.

8.) If the points_earned>=61, print "Great job!" to the user.
    elif the points_earned<10, print "What happened??" to the user.
    else, print "Sorry, you didn't go very far."

9.) Print "Thank you for using our program."
